# paper-metabar-accuracy
Repository with data and code for the ms evaluating the accuracy of occurrence and abundance estimations from metabarcoding data.

## R scripts

### `match_lysate_homogenate.R`
Generates files with calibrated lysate, homogenate and matched lysate-homogenate data.

The files are as follows (also provided in the github repo)
1. `shared_lysates.tsv`. Data frame with clusters as rows and lysate reads in each of the shared samples as columns.
2. `shared_homogenates.tsv`. Ditto for homogenates. 
3. `matched_lysate_homogenate.tsv`. Melted data frame with samples, lysate reads and homogenate reads for all cases where a cluster was detected either in homogenates or lysates.

All files contain full taxonomic information for the cluster. The last file is > 50 MB and needs to be gzipped in github to avoid warning messages.

### `plot_abundance_calib.R`
Generates plots illustrating the power of various calibration procedures using spike-ins in reducing the variance in read numbers. All samples with spike-in reads are used, that is, the lysate data are based on all lysate samples, not only the ones that were also homogenized.
The generated plots are `Fig_lysate_cals.jpg`, `Fig_homogenate_cals.jpg`and `Fig_calibrations.jpg`. The last plot combines the two others. The panels illustrate raw lysate reads of biological spikeins, lysate reads of biological spikeins calibrated with the other biological spikeins (leave-one-out), the raw homogenate reads, homogenate reads calibrated with synthetic spike-ins, homogenate reads calibrated with biological spikeins, and homogenate reads calibrated using a linear model trying to optimize the combination of information from biological and synthetic spike-ins.

### `plot_matches.R`
Generates plots illustrating the distributions of calibrated read counts for lysates and homogenates for different groups of OTU clusters. The generated figures illustrate the following:
1. `Fig_matched_most_occurring.jpg`: Illustrates the pattern for the 20 clusters detected in the largest number of samples among the samples with both lysate and homogenate data.
2. `Fig_matched_most_reads.jpg`: Pattern for the 20 clusters with the largest read counts among those clusters occurring in more than 100 samples
3. `Fig_matched_least_reads.jpg`: Pattern for the 20 clusters with the smallest read counts among those clusters occurring in more than 100 samples
4. `Fig_matched_largest_lysate_surplus.jpg`: Pattern for the 20 clusters with the largest surplus (proportion) of lysate read counts among those clusters occurring in more than 100 samples
5. `Fig_matched_largest_homogenate_surplus.jpg`: Pattern for the 20 clusters with the largest surplus (proportion) of homogenate read counts among those clusters occurring in more than 100 samples

### `generate_match_stats.R`
Generates more detailed statistics for the matching of lysate and homogenate reads. The statistics are printed to the file `match_stats.txt`.
